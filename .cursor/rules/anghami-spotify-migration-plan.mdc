## 📋 Project Overview

**Objective**: Build a comprehensive migration tool that transfers user-created playlists from Anghami to Spotify with full metadata, cover art, and track matching capabilities.

**Architecture**: Modular, phase-based development with independent components that can be tested and debugged separately.

**Tech Stack**:
- Python 3.10+
- Spotify Web API (OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow)
- Web scraping for Anghami (BeautifulSoup4, Selenium)
- Rich/Textual for UI components
- Requests for HTTP operations
- Pillow for image processing

---

## **Phase 3.5**

### **Phase C: Playlist Enhancement System** 🎵 *READY TO START*

#### **C.1 - Real Anghami Playlist Integration (Days 8-9)** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Backend Changes**: ✅ **ALL IMPLEMENTED**
  - ✅ **Removed hardcoded playlist data** from `backend_api.py` `/playlists` endpoint 
  - ✅ **Created AnghamiUserPlaylistDiscoverer** as complementary script to extract user playlists
  - ✅ **Implemented playlist type detection** (created vs followed playlists)
  - ✅ **Added profile-based playlist discovery** that navigates to sectionId=5 (created) and sectionId=10 (followed)
  - ✅ **Error handling** for private/restricted playlists with graceful fallbacks
  - ✅ **Enhanced pagination support** with 4-phase aggressive scrolling system

**Implemented API Endpoints**: ✅
```python
GET /playlists  # Now uses real extraction instead of hardcoded data
GET /playlists/{playlist_id}  # Enhanced with real track extraction
GET /anghami/playlists?type=all|created|followed&page=1&limit=20  # NEW
GET /anghami/playlists/summary  # NEW - Total counts by type
```

**Key Accomplishments**:
- ✅ **Real Playlist Discovery**: `anghami_user_playlist_discoverer.py` successfully extracts both created and followed playlists
- ✅ **Enhanced Scrolling**: 4-phase scrolling system ensures ALL playlists are loaded
- ✅ **Playlist Type Detection**: Clear distinction between user-created (🎵) and followed (➕) playlists
- ✅ **Backend Integration**: All endpoints now use real data extraction instead of hardcoded samples
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for failed extractions with informative error messages
- ✅ **Testing Validated**: Successfully tested on profiles 3186485 (23 playlists) and 16055208 (multiple playlists)

**Technical Implementation Details**:
- Created new `AnghamiUserPlaylistDiscoverer` class with enhanced scrolling
- Updated `backend_api.py` to integrate real playlist extraction
- Added pagination and filtering support
- Implemented comprehensive error handling and logging
- Real cover art URLs, descriptions, and metadata extraction

**Enhanced AnghamiProfileExtractor Methods**:
```python
async def extract_user_playlists(self, profile_url: str, playlist_type: str = "all") -> List[AnghamiPlaylistSummary]
async def extract_created_playlists(self, page) -> List[AnghamiPlaylistSummary]  
async def extract_followed_playlists(self, page) -> List[AnghamiPlaylistSummary]

### Phase 6: Comprehensive Logging & Missing Track Management
**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Priority**: Medium

#### 6.1 Advanced Logging System
**Objective**: Implement detailed logging for debugging and user feedback

**Log File Structure**:
- `migrate_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.log`: Main migration log
- `missing_<playlist>_<timestamp>.log`: Per-playlist missing tracks
- `errors_<timestamp>.log`: Error-only log for debugging

**Logging Levels**:
```python
# Main migration events
logger.info("🎵 Starting migration of playlist: {name}")
logger.info("✅ Successfully created Spotify playlist: {id}")
logger.warning("⚠️ Could not find match for track: {title} by {artist}")
logger.error("❌ Failed to upload cover art: {error}")

# Detailed debug information
logger.debug("🔍 Searching Spotify for: {search_query}")
logger.debug("📊 Match confidence score: {score:.2f}")
```

**Missing Tracks Log Format**:
```json
{
  "playlist_name": "My Awesome Playlist",
  "anghami_playlist_url": "https://anghami.com/playlist/123",
  "spotify_playlist_id": "3cEYpjA9oz9GiPac4AsH4n",
  "missing_tracks": [
    {
      "title": "Rare Song",
      "artists": ["Unknown Artist"],
      "album": "Limited Edition",
      "duration": 245,
      "search_attempts": [
        {"query": "track:\"Rare Song\" artist:\"Unknown Artist\"", "results": 0},
        {"query": "Rare Song Unknown Artist", "results": 3, "best_match_score": 0.45}
      ],
      "anghami_url": "https://anghami.com/track/456"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Deliverables**:
- `logging_config.py`: Structured logging setup

    last_update: datetime

class StateManager:
    def save_state(self, state: MigrationState) -> None:
        """Persist migration state to disk"""
        
    def load_state(self, session_id: str) -> Optional[MigrationState]:
        """Load previous migration state"""
        
    def should_resume_playlist(self, playlist_id: str) -> bool:
        """Check if playlist migration was completed"""
```
