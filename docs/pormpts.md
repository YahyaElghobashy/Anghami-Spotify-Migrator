2. as you can see the playlsits retrieved are withot any info and are not sorted optimally or any filtering capabilities are present. can you optimze the UI of sorting, filtering, etc. of the playlists of anghami and spotify both in a way that is very usabele and intuitive to users.

3. when i chose to migrate one of the playlists, another tap of chrome was openned and closed and nothing was created on spotify and it just ended the implementation cycle. it felt like a demo and not the real migration code

4, ofcourse no spotify playlists were listed or sorted to copare with the selected playlists of the user and to check if the anghami si eligble for migrate,sync, or no change in the playlist. we need to see those playlists and to handle all 3 cases perfectly.
